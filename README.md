## Product vision
For pub/restaurant businesses, customers 

Who would not have the resources to make their own custom system that fits government guidelines even if they change, to help customers follow guidelines easily 

The CleanTable mobile app and web interface 

Is a table management/booking system, advisory system for venue owners, contact detail storage system for contact tracing 

That takes the burden of keeping up with restrictions off both owners and customers
